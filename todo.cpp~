done 1) Random shuffles or manual shoe (default random shuffle on 6 decks)
done 2) Split to 3 or 4 hands (default 4 hands) 
done 3) Can resplit aces (default can resplit)
done 4) house soft 17 hit or stand (default hit)

done 7) For overall.html, could you add percentage for total player bust & total house bust?
    eg 14.3 % & 23.6%
done 8) For trip_allover.html, could you add one more column to the right of balance the accumulated balance?
    The accumulated balance is the sum of balances. eg add up balance of trip 1,
    trip 2, trip 3 at the right of balance of trip 3.
done 9) And I need to add an option of surrender or no surrender to our other options.
    For no surrender, the player have to hit.

done 10) Double down on 9,10,11 or any 2 cards (default any 2 cards)
    The basic strategy for double down on 9,10, 11 is
   i) player 9 vs house 3,4,5,6
  ii) player 10 vs house 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
 iii) player 11 vs house 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
   The basic strategy for double down on any 2 cards is
     i) player 9 vs house 3,4,5,6
    ii) player 10 vs house 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
   iii) player 11 vs house 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
   iv) player A2, A3 vs house 5,6
    v) player A4, A5 vs house 4,5,6
   vi) player A6, A7 vs house 3,4,5,6
   
done 11) Sorry to inform you that for 5,5 & 10,10, never split them.
	For 5,5 it's double down against house 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	For 10,10 it's always stay.

12) House BJ win all or win original bet of player (default win original bet)
   This difference is reflected on basic strategy
   For BJ win all, the double down & split strategy is
i) player 11 vs house 10 is hit
ii) player AA vs house A is hit
   For BJ win original bet, the double down & split startegy is
i) player 11 vs house 10 is double down
ii) player AA vs house A is split

13) Can player split one bet only? (default cannot split one bet only)

Hi Kostis,
This chart is for you to split player cards for having 2 bets in a box.
One bet will be lesser & another one behind will be more.
Eg one bet $25 & another bet $500.
You will look at the player cards will pair (eg 22,44,99...etc)
You will see 2 colours red & green.
For those with green colour, both bets will be split.
For those with red colour, split the $25 bet only. The $500 will not be splitted.
Do you understand by now?
Let me know if you have any doubts?
Thanks & best regards,
Yee
